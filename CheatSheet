## Tips for playing:
1. When selecting the wand, make sure you pick "Phoenix Feather" or "Thestral tail core". They are Potter's wand and Elder wand respectively.
   These wands will give additional boost to the spells and hence higher probability to win

2. When firing spells, make sure to use unforgivable spells first (that has higher powers). They are "Avada Kedavra", "Sectum Sempra",
   "Crucio" and "Imperio". Rest of the spells are less powerful.

3. If you step on a bomb in minefield, try to remember the previous steps. It will come in handy in your next attempt.
