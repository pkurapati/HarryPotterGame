## Reflection:

## FUN PART:
* I was a big fan of J.K Rowling's books and used to get the books on its first day of release. So, making this game was lot of fun.

* Designing the game was tricky because I had to keep the essence of the book intact yet make it interesting to the player.

* I really liked the aspects of selecting the wand, Dueling with Death Eaters (bad guys!) etc.

* I tweaked my game based on input from my 10 year old son who played it multiple times and gave me good inputs :)

* All in all, using all the principles of OOP, dictionaries, lists, loops etc into a project was a very useful excercise.

## Challenges:
* The main challenge was in tuning the game to make sure it is not too easy or not too difficult. 

* I struggled a bit to decide how much power a spell need to have, what frequency it should be used, the initial health and life of wizards etc.

* While the game framework was all ready, tuning it took some time to get it right.

## Code details:
654 lines of code + 1 JSON file for spells
3 classes and 14 methods inside the classes.
8 global methods (including main)

## How to Play:
1. You need to import both Potter.py and Spells.json in the same directory.

2. Start "python3 Potter.py" and just follow the instructions

3. At any stage of the game, you can just type "q" to quit. This includes when firing spells, even though the option "q" is not explicitly shown.

GOOD LUCK MUGGLES!
